# Tickets

As Action IT is based within Action Lab, we use a shared ticket system.

We setup a custom ticket form for each client, which can be accessed via the following link [https://support.actionlab.dev](https://support.actionlab.dev). This link is shared directly with clients.

You will be notified via email when a new ticket for an Action IT project is submitted or updated. You will then need to login to the dashboard at [https://action-lab.zendesk.com/agent](https://action-lab.zendesk.com/agent) using the Action IT common credentials and action the ticket.

**All communication outside of a bust cycle that relates to an existing or prior project needs to be conducted via the ticket system - not via email. This is because it is likely that different members of Action IT will be answering these tickets.**
