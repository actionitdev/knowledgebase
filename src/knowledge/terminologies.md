# The Terms We Use

Every organisation uses different terms (mostly for the same thing). Here is a list of the ones we've realised we use a lot...

## Clients

Clients (or sometimes partners) are NGOs who need IT projects delivering. We work with them to break down their challenges into small chunks (`projects`). In many cases we also act as a an IT support capacity for these clients.

## Projects

Projects are small, well scoped chunks of work that are commissioned, implemented and delivered within a single `burst`.

## Burst Cycle

In our burst mode of working, projects are fully completed by volunteers within a 10 week time-frame (aligned with teaching semesters).


Other than the executive and supervisor board, there are various volunteering roles within Action IT.

## Delivery Lead

The delivery lead is the `project` owner. They have responsibility for making sure that the client is kept in the loop during the project burst, and in managing the software engineers within the team allocated to the project.

## Project Team

A group of software engineers who have been allocated to work on a burst mode project.

## Software Engineer

Our primary role into which we recruit students. In this role, you will work on a single project in bust mode per semester.
