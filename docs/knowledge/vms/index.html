A volunteer management process ensures that your organization or event operates efficiently, saves time and resources while ensuring volunteer retention. This guide will help you analyze the available options and help the team efficiently use the best Volunteer Management System available at the market.</p> <p>We have identified the requirements for an efficient volunteering management system by conducting multiple interviews with various volunteering organizations, ranging from small organizations with about 20 volunteers to large-scale global volunteering organizations based in multiple countries like Kenya. A total of seven interviews were conducted.</p> <p>Based on the interviews and analysis of solutions, it was identified that solutions will depend largely on the type and scale of the organization. Hence, organizations can be classified into 3 different categories based on the scale of organization and requirements. After that, based on which category an organization lies in, a solution can be suggested. A decision tree is also included in the report which will help different organizations to select any solution based on requirements.</p> <p>In addition to the decision tree, a scoring matrix is also included with the report. In the scoring matrix, different features required for a volunteering management solution have been categorized and listed. Then for each solution, a score is assigned for each feature. Users can refer to this scoring matrix to get help on deciding a solution.</p> <p>Note this report offers a general overview and evaluation of available volunteering management solutions. Data and information collected may vary over time and can be subjective. Clients are advised to use the recommendations as one of the many references available. Decisions on implementation should be made after clients’ own evaluation based on specific environments and requirements.</p> <h1 id="features-of-volunteer-management-system"><a href="#features-of-volunteer-management-system" class="header-anchor">#</a> Features of Volunteer Management System</h1> <p>Technology is shaping the way that volunteers can be managed by NGOs. It’s no wonder that nonprofits are always in search of the latest and smart software that helps track the volunteers and their impact. Fortunately, there is a variety of software available for Volunteer Management, each with a range of features. But have you thought about what features would be most useful for Volunteer Management?</p> <p>A volunteer management system can have a range of simple to complex functionalities based on the requirement of organizations. Some of the key features of a volunteer management system are as follows:</p> <ul><li>A simple record of volunteer details. This can include records of volunteer details like name, skills, availability, location, gender, age, interests, ability to work from home, etc.</li> <li>Sign up facility for volunteers. This can be implemented in different ways
<ul><li>Manual registration. Volunteers can contact administrators through email or by calling. Administrators will then enter the details manually into the database.</li> <li>Organizations can publish registration forms through the mail or publishing registration links through various social media sources.</li> <li>Portal for volunteers. Volunteers can directly visit the organizations portal and register to the organization</li></ul></li> <li>Publishing volunteering opportunities.
<ul><li>For very small organizations, this can be done by manually contacting volunteers based on the records in the database.</li> <li>Using systems like Zoho creator, administrators can selectively publish opportunities to selected volunteers based on skill or other factors.</li> <li>Dashboard for volunteers in which all volunteering opportunities can be published.</li></ul></li> <li>Rostering of volunteers to opportunities.
<ul><li>Volunteers need to be rostered to opportunities suitable for them. For small organizations, this can be done manually but for wider organizations, it needs to be facilitated with minimum administration overhead.</li></ul></li> <li>Record of volunteer contributions.
<ul><li>Volunteers might spend hours involved in various activities. Both administrators and volunteers should be able to track the hours spent by volunteers.</li></ul></li> <li>Reward mechanism in form of certificates.
<ul><li>Volunteers should be able to receive some sort of certificate as a form of acknowledgment for their contributions.
Reporting tools. Reports to cover various organization needs. An example of this includes</li> <li>Internal report to track contribution by various volunteers, their involvement, and other general data</li> <li>External reports for advisory boards, funding organizations, or for publishing to the general public.
Ability to store documents. Support documents like volunteers rostering information, volunteering opportunities available, etc can be stored in the system itself.
Onboarding process. Onboarding of volunteers to an organization requires various induction and training processes. If these are integrated into a single platform, it will make the working of the organization more efficient and simpler.
Ability to integrate to existing CRM or other systems. Some organizations might already have a simple CRM or database to manage volunteers, but are now looking for an upgrade. In such a case, the ability for the new system to integrate into the existing system will be very useful.</li></ul></li></ul> <p>Here in this section of the document, we gathered insights into a few must-have features NGOs are looking for in an ideal Volunteer Management System.</p> <h2 id="online-background-checks-for-efficiency"><a href="#online-background-checks-for-efficiency" class="header-anchor">#</a> Online Background Checks for Efficiency:</h2> <ul><li>Background checks for Volunteer Management Systems are really necessary to help create a safer environment inside the NGOs.</li> <li>By implementing/integrating background checks, it can be more productive while creating a better experience for the volunteers.</li> <li>When the volunteers register for an opportunity through the Volunteer Management System, they can be directed to finish an automatic background check.</li> <li>These background checks can also be attached to the profile of each volunteer so that they can view and manage them efficiently.</li></ul> <h2 id="web-based-volunteer-management"><a href="#web-based-volunteer-management" class="header-anchor">#</a> Web-based Volunteer Management.</h2> <ul><li>The Advantage of technology can be imputed into the traditional Volunteer Management System to transform into a smart system.</li> <li>Web-based technologies can help volunteers and NGOs from anywhere and everywhere.</li> <li>Having a centralized platform can help
<ul><li>Volunteers to explore and engage with multiple volunteer opportunities.</li> <li>Organizations to promote their volunteer needs and requirements.</li> <li>NGOs to schedule and manage volunteers efficiently.</li></ul></li> <li>Here we have listed a few important software capabilities to consider,
<ul><li>Bag of Opportunities: Clean interface to list the available opportunities, scheduling is simplified when volunteers sign up themselves into the opportunities.</li> <li>Volunteer Database: Data is fuel to any Volunteer Management System. Therefore a dedicated database for storing and maintaining the volunteers is required based on the scale of NGOs.</li> <li>Volunteer Event Management: NGOs may oversee multiple events and programs with multiple organizations across multiple locations. So a centralized system must be able to manage these events from anywhere.</li> <li>Data Tracking: A log on the volunteer work hour can be calculated so that NGOs can view the effectiveness of the volunteer work via visualizations.</li></ul></li></ul> <h2 id="centralized-communication-hub"><a href="#centralized-communication-hub" class="header-anchor">#</a> Centralized Communication Hub.</h2> <ul><li>Communication is an important aspect to maintain real connections with the volunteers.</li> <li>Software with a Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) would be the most effective and efficient to send emails, texts to volunteers regarding any volunteer opportunities available.</li> <li>This way it can reduce the purchase of a separate CRM to manage and schedule volunteers.</li> <li>Here we have listed some additional features that can be considered,
<ul><li>Automated Communication: When volunteers register for a volunteer opportunity, the system can automatically “Thank” the volunteer for registering.</li> <li>Group SMS: If you need to communicate with a group of volunteers regarding a particular event, then this service comes as a handy tool.</li> <li>Mobile Notifications: This is an additional feature where we can have a centralized mobile app that notifies volunteers of any new volunteer opportunity popping out.</li> <li>Social Media: Just like Facebook and Instagram that help people get connected and socialize, Volunteer Management System can also integrate professional Social networking media, where like-minded volunteers can get in touch and share things.</li></ul></li></ul> <h2 id="volunteer-skill-match"><a href="#volunteer-skill-match" class="header-anchor">#</a> Volunteer Skill match:</h2> <ul><li>By understanding more about the volunteers, You'll be able to target messaging and provide a better personalized user experience for each individual if you learn more about your volunteers, such as the causes they support and the skills they can contribute.</li> <li>An effective skill match of the volunteers with the available opportunities helps the work done more efficiently.</li></ul> <p>Especially a transformation from Small scale to Medium Scale NGOs, the Volunteer management software can replace your Excel sheets/spreadsheets. The volunteer management software must unite all aspects of the volunteer program, from engagement to management. You can ensure that your registration, background checks, and communication systems are all consolidated, organized, and easily accessible with the correct system in place. These helpful features are meant to streamline your operations and cut down on administrative time so you can focus on the people who help you achieve your goals.</p> <h1 id="six-steps-for-better-volunteer-management"><a href="#six-steps-for-better-volunteer-management" class="header-anchor">#</a> Six Steps for Better Volunteer Management</h1> <p>This section will help you understand the Volunteer Management Process, where a clear understanding of this can help you choose the right VMS tool required, based on the size of the NGO being focussed into the picture.

Eight Interviews were conducted and we identified various requirements for a volunteer management system. It is summarized below:</p> <ul><li>The requirements of a volunteer management system largely differ based on the size of the organization.</li> <li>For small-scale organizations (less than 50 volunteers), requirements are simple. Mostly they only need a simple record of all volunteers as task assignment, hour tracking, and other functions happen informally over the call or talk in person.</li> <li>Normally small-scale organizations do not have a specialized IT team.</li> <li>For medium-scale organizations, the requirements might be a bit more complex. They need something more advanced than a simple database.</li> <li>Medium-scale organizations might have few IT resources, but their skill and specializations may not be enough to support entire IT-specific systems.</li> <li>For medium scale, in addition to volunteer records they might also need functionalities like:
<ul><li>Volunteer registration portal: Volunteers should be able to directly register to the organization or events. This will decrease the management overhead on administrators multi-fold.</li> <li>Volunteers should be able to view and register for events: There should be a volunteer portal that can be accessed by volunteers to view all the volunteering opportunities available near them.</li> <li>Track hours: System to track hours spent by each volunteer.</li> <li>Ability to generate reports.</li></ul></li> <li>For large-scale organizations, an advanced volunteer management system is required. They need advanced data processing.
<ul><li>Most organizations might have some existing systems. Hence the ability to integrate the existing system into a new one should be provided.</li> <li>Organizations might exist in different countries. Hence the system should be compliant with all regional and national policies.</li></ul></li></ul> <h1 id="overview-of-shortlisted-solutions"><a href="#overview-of-shortlisted-solutions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Overview of shortlisted Solutions</h1> <table><thead><tr><th>Small</th> <th>Medium</th> <th>Large</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Less Number of Volunteers (0-50)</td> <td>More volunteers compared to small NGOs (50-400)</td> <td>A large number of Volunteers.

They include</p> <ul><li>The number of volunteers: It is one key factor based on which the identification of the category in which the solution lies is done.</li> <li>Technical expertise is available in the organization. This is one key factor that determines whether the system needs an IT specialist to handle or can be done by anyone.</li> <li>Integration with existing CRM. Many volunteering organizations already have some sort of small system in place like maybe a simple CRM. They might need a solution that can be integrated into their existing system.</li> <li>Pricing. Pricing is a very important factor as many small organizations lack a lot of funding and some sort of economic solution will be best suited for them.</li> <li>Integrated training facility.</li></ul> <p><strong>Admin/Management</strong></p> <p>Efficient management of the volunteers by single or multiple admins is an essential feature of any volunteering management system. This section includes some features which can be available for admin management to make the work more efficient. This includes various features like the ability for administrators to review and select volunteers from all signup requests, the ability to roast volunteers (Manual or automated), track volunteer hours, publish volunteering opportunities, etc.</p> <p><strong>Volunteer Engagement</strong></p> <p>Efficient volunteer engagement is essential for a good volunteering management system. If a portal is present for volunteers through which volunteers can do multiple activities like see various opportunities, register to them,  update their availability, and so on, it can make volunteering management much easier. This can take away a lot of management overhead required and make the process more smooth. For a small organization with maybe less than 20 volunteers, this feature may not be necessary. But in the case of larger organizations, this is an essential feature.</p> <p><strong>Communication</strong></p> <p>Communication is a key factor for volunteer management. It is essential for good two-way communication between volunteers and the organization. Volunteers should be communicated properly about various volunteering opportunities which they can utilize. Similarly, volunteers should be able to effectively communicate with the organization about their availability, expression of interest to be part of any activities, and so on. Communication can occur through different channels like Email, a news dashboard, SMS, etc.</p> <p><strong>Customer Support</strong></p> <p>Customer support options vary depending on the pricing plan users select, but they usually include email, phone (24/7 or 24/5), online ticketing, live chat, and a knowledge base. Choosing software that offers ample support resources ensures that we have someone to contact in case we run into technical issues.</p> <p><strong>Scoring</strong>
In each section, we rate the software on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent). This has been done by researching the software’s official website, documentation, community forums, and analyzing user reviews on popular software review websites.</p> <p>Full scale: 1 = very poor, 2 = poor, 3 = average, 4 = good, and 5 = excellent.</p> <p>If a vendor does not offer a listed function, we give the score a 0. Finally, total scores are calculated by the weighted sum of the individual sections. The higher the total score, the specific vendor meets our criteria. Weighting assigned to each criteria is based on project members’ experience and findings from interviews. Clients are encouraged to review the weighting based on their specific environments.</p> <p>The scoring matrix is present in the following link: Software Selection Matrix
