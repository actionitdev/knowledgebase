Features have been divided into essential and others so that they can be given different weightings.</p> <h3 id="operating-specifications"><a href="#operating-specifications" class="header-anchor">#</a> Operating specifications</h3> <p>Operating specifications cover the following aspects:</p> <ul><li>Ease of use and implementation</li> <li>Deployment options including on-premise personal computer, server and cloud</li> <li>Supported operating system including Windows, Mac and Linux</li> <li>Mobile compatibility with iOS and Android</li></ul> <p>We recommend clients to verify the compatibility of such solutions with their existing technology infrastructure and applications. We also recommend clients to choose a suitable deployment model (on-premise or cloud), and verify which operating systems (OS) are supported: Windows, Mac, or Linux. This will ensure that the client can run the software on their system.</p> <p>We also inquire if the vendor offers mobile applications for iOS and Android devices.</p> <h3 id="customer-support"><a href="#customer-support" class="header-anchor">#</a> Customer support</h3> <p>Customer support options vary depending on the pricing plan users select, but they usually include email, phone (24/7 or 24/5), online ticketing, live chat, and a knowledge base. Choosing a software which offers ample support resources ensures that we have someone to contact in case we run into technical issues.</p> <h3 id="pricing"><a href="#pricing" class="header-anchor">#</a> Pricing</h3> <p>For each software shortlisted, we identified pricing-related details such as upfront cost, ongoing cost, free trial details, and any special rates, discounts, or promotions.</p> <h2 id="scoring"><a href="#scoring" class="header-anchor">#</a> Scoring</h2> <p>In each section, we rate the softwares on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent). This has been done by researching the softwareâ€™s official website, documentation, community forums and analyzing user reviews on popular software review websites such as GetApp, G2, TrustRadius, SourceForge and Capterra.</p> <p>Full scale: 1 = very poor, 2 = poor, 3 = average, 4 = good, and 5 = excellent.</p> <p>If a vendor doesn't offer a listed function, we leave the score field as 0.</p> <p>Finally total scores are calculated by the weighted sum of the individual sections. The higher the total score, the a specific vendor meets our criteria. Weighting assigned to each criteria is based on project membersâ€™ experience and finding from interviews. Clients are encouraged to review the weighting based on their specific environments.</p> <p>A detailed evaluation matrix is available at the following link: https://bit.ly/3oHB6YR.</p> <p>A summary of the feature evaluation is shown in the scoring table, with total score and corresponding ranking, and heatmap below.</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Software Score Summary</th> <th></th> <th></th> <th></th> <th></th> <th></th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td></td> <td>SaaS</td> <td></td> <td>Open-source</td> <td></td> <td></td></tr> <tr><td></td> <td>Quickbooks Online</td> <td>Zoho Books</td> <td>ERPNext</td> <td>Akaunting</td> <td>Weight</td></tr> <tr><td>Essential Features</td> <td>42</td> <td>33</td> <td>35</td> <td>23</td> <td>40%</td></tr> <tr><td>Other Features</td> <td>19</td> <td>22</td> <td>29</td> <td>20</td> <td>10%</td></tr> <tr><td>Customer Support</td> <td>16</td> <td>10</td> <td>4</td> <td>4</td> <td>10%</td></tr> <tr><td>Operating Specifications</td> <td>31</td> <td>30</td> <td>26</td> <td>26</td> <td>20%</td></tr> <tr><td>Pricing</td> <td>7</td> <td>8</td> <td>5</td> <td>5.5</td> <td>20%</td></tr> <tr><td>Total Score</td> <td>27.9</td> <td>24.0</td> <td>23.5</td> <td>17.9</td> <td></td></tr> <tr><td>Rank</td> <td>1</td> <td>2</td> <td>3</td> <td>4</td> <td></td></tr></tbody></table> <h2 id="result-discussion"><a href="#result-discussion" class="header-anchor">#</a> Result Discussion</h2> <p>Quickbooks online achieves the best ranking with well-rounded performance in every criteria we evaluate. It is most suitable for medium and large organisations with knowledgeable financial staff. Zoho books comes second in the ranking offering a good range of basic accounting features free of charge and reasonable tiers of subscription fee for additional features. It is suitable for startup NGOs with a general lack of accounting knowledge amongst staff. ERPNext earns third in our ranking, behind SaaS solutions particularly due to its lack of customer support and the fact that open-source software requires well-versed IT staff and possibly additional hardware and software implementation. The ranking may rise if aforementioned requirements are available. ERPNext does offer a reasonable suite of ERP functions which may appeal to medium and large organisations. Akaunting comes last in the ranking as it offers less basic features with its free installation offer. Additional purchase for some relevant functionalities from third party integration may be required.</p> <p>A summary of the detail evaluation is provided in Table 4, displayed in the form of a heat map.
